### üó∫Ô∏è Overview
- This backend project serves as a Proxy Server for NewsPanda web application.
- Direct data fetch request from NewsPanda website to NewsAPI server falls under Cross-site request category. The request will hit the server but browser will block the response due to CORS(cross-origin resource sharing) protection....
- Since NewsAPI don't need corresponding user credentials from Browser profile to be tied with request body, we can bypass the CORS issue using a proxy server. 
- Request made by a server (Proxy Server on Render in our case) is seen as an interaction by a remote machine, hence Browser does not automatically ties user credentials related to NewsAPI and therefore CORS is not enforced. This allows us to successfully retrieve data from NewsAPI website.

### üõ†Ô∏è Architecture
- The project is a lightweight Express-based Proxy server that handles client request for news data.
- Axios API is used for communicating with Newsapi server based on the dynamic query parameters received from frontend.
- CORS  middleware is configured to grant secured access to NewsPanda frontend, enabling it to communicate with the proxy server without browser-side CORS restrictions. After server receives a request, CORS middleware updates response headers such as Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Headers, and then lets the route handler handle next.

### ‚ú® Features
- API keys are encapsulated using Environmental variables via dotenv to avoid accidental exposure in source code or public repositories.
- Data fetch algorithm is wrapped in an Error handling structure to account for unexpected errors.
